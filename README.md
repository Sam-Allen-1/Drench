You start with the square in the top left corner - this is your area.
You add to your area by linking neighbouring squares that are the same colour by clicking the 5 buttons at the bottom. 
The goal is to fill the whole board with the same colour in the smallest amount of turns possible. 
Once you have done this, click restart to try and beat your score!
